1214707671388962816 2020-01-08 10:37:31 AEST <one_stinky_rat> Are people forgetting the fact that these fires were all over Australia? Even if there were an #arsonemergency the conditions were so bad, and the fires growing so huge, it would require so much mental gymnastics to believe anything other than climate change was responsible.
1214707642674757632 2020-01-08 10:37:24 AEST <whataphoney> #arsonEmergency yes incidence of deliberately lighting fires, but  predominantly due to attempts at DIY land clearing.

1214706863670882304 2020-01-08 10:34:19 AEST <hanny_hawkins> This is the problem: spurious ‘balance’.

Side note, does anyone have a pool I can use? It's been unusually hot lately for some reason. Probably a Greenie ploy to bring the sun closer.

1214706396253417472 2020-01-08 10:32:27 AEST <EliJack27497498> There are, on average, 62,000 bushfires in Australia EVERY year.   A 2015 satellite analysis of 113,000 fires from 1997-2009 indicates 40% of fires are deliberately lit, another 47% accidental.   Combined, 87% are man-made.  Not climate change. #ArsonEmergency
1214706367849648128 2020-01-08 10:32:20 AEST <aussie000050> I find it strange that it’s only the 24 Nsw arsonist arrests that have been made that media are mentioning and not any other states arrests.

1214704737188110336 2020-01-08 10:25:52 AEST <FrancisVierboom> Lots of bushfires started by humans/arsonists this season. Also similar number & percentage started in previous seasons. Climate change doesn't start bushfires, it makes them worse because it causes SE Aus droughts and dry fuel burns faster. #ArsonEmergency #BullshitAvalanche

Just because #AustraliaFires were started by arsonists, doesn't mean they weren't also caused by climate change. In fact, this #ArsonEmergency is likely a result of the #ClimateEmergency.
1214703887694721025 2020-01-08 10:22:29 AEST <DionCDetterer> So, let's recap:  1) The country is on fire and fake news is flooding social media via the #ArsonEmergency hashtag, while massive amounts of CO2 pouring into the atmosphere. 2) Iran and the US are starting a war in Iraq, with a genuine fear that Trump will escalate further.

1214693187307986944 2020-01-08 09:39:58 AEST <MaddyLove2018> The vast majority (~90%) of fires ignited in country Victoria happen in farmland from machinery/electricity-related incidents.

1214692913705177088 2020-01-08 09:38:53 AEST <jfrcoates> Casual reminder that #ArsonEmergency is intended to deflect attention away from the #ClimateEmergency that has caused the #AustralianBushfiresDisaster   Even if some fires were created by arsonists, that doesn't ignore the fact that climate change has strengthened the blazes.

1214678302893297669 2020-01-08 08:40:49 AEST <OzraeliAvi> There are, on average, 62,000 bushfires in Australia EVERY year.   A 2015 satellite analysis of 113,000 fires from 1997-2009 indicates 40% of fires are deliberately lit, another 47% accidental.   Combined, 87% are man-made.  Not climate change. #ArsonEmergency

1214665843117711361 2020-01-08 07:51:19 AEST <miserabledrunk> the top post on the #ArsonEmergency tag when I clicked on it was a tweet using the expression "climate change denial traitors".  So dramatic.
1214665780727468032 2020-01-08 07:51:04 AEST <CultureInOz> I'd like to know who sent the first tweets pushing #ArsonEmergency , it was probably a LWNJ coz already their bible the guardian have posted a story on it and it's not even 9am. Looks suspect to me, probably their own bots too.

1214662690573971456 2020-01-08 07:38:47 AEST <DeanRosario> And, right on cue...  Analysing a samples of Tweets from 1-6 Jan, 2020 a QUT researcher has found "a social media disinformation campaign is pushing false conspiracy theories about their cause... using #ArsonEmergency"   https://www.zdnet.com/article/twitter-bots-and-trolls-promote-conspiracy-theories-about-australian-bushfires/ … https://twitter.com/DeanRosario/status/1214443027227242497 …

1214660299086684160 2020-01-08 07:29:17 AEST <DarrylKerrigan3> It's funny, when you talk to the people in the country with property lost, they say the same thing, lack of hazard reduction.   Its a combination of huge fuel load, drought, and nothing to do with climate change.  If anything it's an #ArsonEmergency with over 180 charged so far.
1214660291562065920 2020-01-08 07:29:15 AEST <ImTheWelder> We are smack dab in the middle of #Australias911 and some fucked up intrest wants to push some Arson crap for all the idiots to gobble up??

1214660013882372097 2020-01-08 07:28:09 AEST <TClarksonMusic> Also, here's an ABC (the most reliable in Australia) article citing #ArsonEmergency  has been falsely propagated by suspicious, automated accounts. Any reliable literature says 3 fire causes in Oz: heat, dry and lightning strikes. Arson sadly a factor but not the main one.
1214659923277176833 2020-01-08 07:27:47 AEST <bymindfulsteph> Arson has always existed. The climate is getting hotter & drier, allowing the fire ignited by arson OR by natural causes to burn fiercer for longer. This is a #ClimateEmergency, and though it may be exacerbated by arson, it's no #ArsonEmergency. Listen to scientists not hashtags.

1214565870610997258 2020-01-08 01:14:03 AEST <ausnostra> #ArsonEmergency  is trending mainly due to those that claim it is a bot conspiracy. The fact is all these emergency hashtags including #ClimateEmergency are counterproductive to a considered and enduring response to bushland management and hazard reduction to avoid #firecrisis https://twitter.com/Vic_Rollison/status/1214491641190305792 …
1214564291656863749 2020-01-08 01:07:47 AEST <AwakenedLeftie> Too calculated to so casually dismiss them as “idiots”.  And too contentious - given our #ArsonEmergency - to dismiss calculated sabotage as a random act.  Patterns of behaviour are becoming visible.   #ArsonDenial without adequate investigation and analysis suggests complicity.

1214559797451689984 2020-01-08 00:49:55 AEST <JohnTay37289429> That a researcher ran to the media about it all being a bot conspiracy makes #ArsonEmergency more credible, not less.  Sample size?

Most were never caught. One arsonist rode a trail bike, lit multiple fires in the bush over months. Never caught.  #ArsonEmergency

1214422772207587329 2020-01-07 15:45:26 AEST <CorrelaWhite> Hey Hillary, our fires were NOT spurred on by climate change. It is a case of bad forest management influences by environmental activists & the fact that nearly 200 people have so far been charged with deliberately lighting the fires. It is an #ArsonEmergency not climate change.

1214348409441681408 2020-01-07 10:49:56 AEST <MiscreantMe> Exactly. I was in the NSWFB (Retained) in a rural area for 5 years. 90% of our call outs were arson related (bushfires, stolen cars, garbage bins). Most were never caught. One arsonist rode a trail bike, lit multiple fires in the bush over months. Never caught.  #ArsonEmergency

1214210169766236162 2020-01-07 01:40:38 AEST <PDidge> I came up against an #arsonemergency advocate. Seems a red herring to me. We agree that arson should be stopped, there are tough laws, but enforcement is really difficult and they are a constant with all bushfires. Also when hazard reducton is max, <ignitions turn to firestorms

1214135948256202752 2020-01-06 20:45:42 AEST <JamesDe34061167> Yes the #ArsonEmergency continues in Australia.  Every day more arsonists are arrested committing terrorism against fellow Australians.  Drought is not new to Australia, but the number of arsonists is unprecedented.  Denial is a socialist trait even when the truth is obvious.
1214135280342429697 2020-01-06 20:43:03 AEST <brobson_politic> It's still an #ArsonEmergency and bushfires started by negligence should still attract massive penalties.  But bushfires started maliciously should be treated and discussed differently to bushfires started through stupidity.

1213586271890628608 2020-01-05 08:21:29 AEST <TruthFairy17> Hi Janis, sadly you’re right!   87% of the fires this season are believed to have been caused by arsonists. Take a look at #ArsonEmergency.   Also unfortunately, our greenies are trying to exploit the current tragedy to push their climate change agenda.

1213382739673485312 2020-01-04 18:52:43 AEST <TheWhogg> Reminder: when the #ArsonEmergency started in August, according to UAH the AUS temp anomaly was +0.24C. Some people believe that had we sucked out 1/3 of all CO2, and starved 1bn people, the 0.24 degrees would have prevented the fires.
1213382260310695936 2020-01-04 18:50:49 AEST <rvpredv> But but i swear #ClimateChange is real and the fire started on it's own and There's no such thing as Arsonist.

These fires didn’t start at the hand of @ScottMorrisonMP we actually have a #ArsonEmergency with over 200 fires deliberately lit. so perhaps just curl up on the lounge and let the grown ups handle the situation.

1212873183201619970 2020-01-03 09:07:55 AEST <AwakenedLeftie> Last number of arrests I heard was “over 200”... that’s just arrests.  My take: This is more an #ArsonEmergency than anything else. The #CCAs  are hoping that after it’s over all that will be remembered is how much burned, not that there were agents.   Why attention is needed.

How do our 6 CP stations compare to China's near 3000 CP stations? #ArsonEmergency  https://twitter.com/DoctorKarl/status/1212517528641032192 …
1212679015833559040 2020-01-02 20:16:22 AEST <philmcgee> Or perhaps this may have something do with it. It's not a climate emergency is an #ArsonEmergency  https://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/national/islam-group-urges-forest-fire-jihad-20080907-geabxj.html …
1212678459803045888 2020-01-02 20:14:09 AEST <brobson_politic> Of the bushfires that were not started by a person, how many of them would have not started if #ClimateChange was not occurring?  I didn't think so, #schmuck!  #ArsonEmergency

1212670061363617792 2020-01-02 19:40:47 AEST <auselection2016> Yes more land clearing, fuel reduction and creation of fire brakes would be a great start - make bush fires national and the allow the federal government over rule state and local gov to manage the land to prevent atrocities. #bushfiresAustralia #BushfireEmergency #ArsonEmergency

1212539044711690241 2020-01-02 11:00:10 AEST <CNePerson> Dear USA tweeps and others, we have an #ArsonEmergency in Australia, and 10+ years of not being allowed to create fire trails and control burn land by Greenie activist councils.  These are the major factors behind the current wildfires, not  CC / AGW.
1212532150286733312 2020-01-02 10:32:47 AEST <Justinslucaj> perhaps a bit more than 5% of the country might do it. until then it’s just a tragic fire lit mainly by #ArsonEmergency  crims taking advantage of gutless government listening to constant protesting from #green creating the fuel loads that are feeding the fires
1212528604187250688 2020-01-02 10:18:41 AEST <hereticaliberal> It's not so much a #ClimateEmegency as it is an #ArsonEmergency
1212524802184904704 2020-01-02 10:03:35 AEST <AwakenedLeftie> This may be an AGW issue - with this much of our nation on fire - it’s very possible.

1212194118354362368 2020-01-01 12:09:33 AEST <AwakenedLeftie> ...well, then better management policies going forward are an excellent place to start - without losing sight of the #ArsonEmergency and #CC aspects either.
1212191688178880512 2020-01-01 11:59:54 AEST <KathyJandM1> The majority of these devastating fires were caused by arson.Many areas were denied hazard reduction burning due to Greens policies. Gumtrees regenerate by fire so they are very volatile. People build in dense bush these days. Fires not caused by @ScottMorrisonMP #ArsonEmergency

1212179766708596738 2020-01-01 11:12:32 AEST <CaptainAdvance1> As well as fake claims that our emissions approach is sufficient and actively promoting more exports of thermal coal, there is an active denialist push on SM. #ArsonEmergency seeks to question worsening fire conditions and the other trope is Oz climate action won't put out fires

1211211022574317568 2019-12-29 19:03:05 AEST <MarthaThomas20> Just heard in the news that the fires in Bendigo yesterday were deliberately lit; the arsonist hasn’t been caught and it’s feared that he will do it again as tomorrow is an extreme fire danger day… thankfully they were able to contain the fires yesterday; it’s an #arsonemergency
1211191093326274561 2019-12-29 17:43:54 AEST <markc01> So many ADF hating Lefty dripwits are suddenly experts on firefighting capabilities and demanding the Army be deployed. 🤷🏽‍♂️🙄🤡 #ArsonEmergency #auspol

Greens pressuring for no clearing of forests, now for years, has built up an enormous powderkeg waiting for this current situation to occur.

1209959765876432897 2019-12-26 08:11:02 AEST <Canberroo> There's a lot of us wondering whether these nutjobs have played a role (directly - or indirectly, thru brainwashed kids) on the arson epidemic we are experiencing here this summer. We've never seen so many fires deliberately lit. It's an #ArsonEmergency, not a #ClimateEmergency

1209344441309286400 2019-12-24 15:25:57 AEST <baldcammel> It's ironic that you're on holiday while Australia burns and an #ArsonEmergency is in play!   Far left propagandists continue to use false or misrepresented reporting but that's no surprise, most lefty reporting has shied away from the tally of arsonists to push the agenda!
1209342315774431232 2019-12-24 15:17:31 AEST <Dr_Camouflage_> What is it with the left and "facts"?  Absolutely absent from the the truth.   Not only misleading and dishonest, its pathetic.

1209222896238809089 2019-12-24 07:22:59 AEST <bill_dobell> In Australia it's more an #ArsonEmergency
1209218358484189184 2019-12-24 07:04:57 AEST <Dr_Camouflage_> You know. Lets not detract from the fact here that Australia has a #ArsonEmergency. People like you who arent calling the arsonists out are the ones actually perpetuating the problem we're facing.

1209119975635443712 2019-12-24 00:34:01 AEST <KingLofichu> And reviewing your timeline your obsession with the current fires being an #ArsonEmergency and not a #ClimateEmergency is quite honestly confusing. Yes there is the Arsonistic involvement in these fires however higher temps can be linked to climate change.

1208677704167329792 2019-12-22 19:16:35 AEST <bill_dobell> No, what we have is in fact an #ArsonEmergency
1208671823279218688 2019-12-22 18:53:13 AEST <Seagullrm> I guess the international media aren't mentioning the 170 people in NSW & Qld who have been charged/cautioned for lighting fires, with more to come.  #ArsonEmergency
1208657187859390464 2019-12-22 17:55:04 AEST <bill_dobell> We have an #ArsonEmergency
1208656956069560320 2019-12-22 17:54:08 AEST <baldcammel> Wrong on all accounts!  Stop relying on MSM for your information!   Looks like another insult swinging lefty relying on loser tactics to suppress the truth..  "No #ArsonEmergency??  How many arsonists does it take to qualify an #ArsonEmergency?
1208649365318844417 2019-12-22 17:23:58 AEST <baldcammel> 'coal (which worsens climate change)'  you're suggesting C02 (that plants use to grow) is the so called climate change culprit?   I guess you don't know that the planet has in fact become more green??  No mention of the massive #ArsonEmergency? Why is that? a 'narrative' issue?

1208637433920671745 2019-12-22 16:36:34 AEST <Seagullrm> So far we are up to 170 people charged/cautioned in relation to bushfires in NSW & Qld with further investigations still pending.  It is quite possible the number could end up near 300 as further investigations are completed.  This would have to be unprecedented. #ArsonEmergency

1207134112101724160 2019-12-18 13:02:54 AEST <dannystevo46> That’s now 70 people been, or about to be charged for bushfire related offences....since August!  Fucking harsher penalties for these pr*cks!  #arsonemergency

1207100234049806337 2019-12-18 10:48:17 AEST <dzmollo> 56 arson charges or warnings since August, which is quite the increase. How many might be climate activists, urged on by Richard’s  ‘inflammatory’ rhetoric (pun intended)?  #arsonemergency

1197709936828014592 2019-11-22 12:54:35 AEST <Flashgordonv> With the vast majority of fires being deliberately lit, a better hashtag for the bushfires instead of #ClimateEmergency is #Arsonemergency. If arsonists are responsible, perhaps find ways to counter arsonists.  https://twitter.com/hashtag/ClimateEmergency?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw …

1197700984782254081 2019-11-22 12:19:01 AEST <AStrongerOZ> Hey, what about Palasczcuk? The Queensland Premier? Or are the left only doing this to Berejiklian? So damn pathetic, Australia has an #ArsonEmergency and not an #ClimateEmergency.
1197683616198717440 2019-11-22 11:10:00 AEST <MarthaThomas20> I wonder whether it has to do with being relentlessly frightened by the climate change zealots … #ArsonEmergency
